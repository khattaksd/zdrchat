# ZDR Chat Landing Page — Build Plan

## Overview

Build the public-facing landing page for **ZDR Chat** (`zdr.chat`) — a serene, modern, privacy-first site with blog, docs, and heavy SEO/AI optimization. Separate from the PWA repo.

**Repo:** `khattaksd/zdrchat-landing` (separate from `zdrchat` PWA repo)
**Stack:** Astro (static, deployed to Cloudflare Pages)
**Domain:** `zdr.chat` → Cloudflare Pages `zdrchat` project

## Content Outline

### Landing Page (`/`)

**Hero:**
```
Headline: Your Private AI. Your Keys. Zero Servers.
Subline: ZDR Chat is a serverless, BYOK chat app powered by OpenRouter.
           No accounts. No logs. No backend. Your data never leaves your browser.
CTA:      [Launch ZDR Chat →]  →  app.zdr.chat
Tagline:  🔒 300+ models • BYOK • Browser-local
```

**Feature Cards (4):**
```
🔐  Bring Your Own Key
    Paste your OpenRouter API key. It's stored in your browser only.
    Never sent anywhere except directly to OpenRouter.

🧠  300+ Models — One Interface
    All OpenRouter models in one place. Smartest, fastest, free, code, vision —
    neatly bucketed so you always pick the right one.

🏠  Zero Servers
    No backend. No accounts. No sign-up. The entire app runs in your browser
    as a static PWA. Deployed to Cloudflare Pages — that's it.

💾  Zero Data Retention
    Every message, every token, every setting stays in your browser's IndexedDB.
    Close the tab — it's gone from the world.
```

**How It Works (3 steps):**
```
1. 🔑 Paste your OpenRouter key
2. 🎯 Pick a model from the browsable picker
3. 💬 Start chatting — encrypted, local, private
```

**Privacy Pledge:**
```
ZDR (Zero Data Retention) means exactly that.

Your conversation history lives in your browser's IndexedDB.
Your API key is stored locally.
We run no servers, maintain no databases, log nothing.

Configure privacy enforcement at the OpenRouter account level,
and every request is ZDR-guaranteed at the network layer.
```

**Footer:**
```

Made for the privacy-conscious. Not affiliated with OpenRouter.

## Pricing & Ethics Positioning

### Core Message

Private AI shouldn't require a trust fund or a data sacrifice.

| Others | ZDR Chat |
|--------|----------|
| "Free" apps monetize your data | We don't — the app costs ~$0/month to host |
| Subscriptions lock you in | Pay OpenRouter directly, no markup |
| Opaque pricing | Per-token cost in the status bar, real-time |
| Affiliated with specific providers | Independent, not affiliated with OpenRouter |

### Not Affiliated (must be visible)

Every blog post and the landing page footer should state: *ZDR Chat is an independent, open-source project. We're not affiliated with OpenRouter.ai — we don't resell their services, earn commissions, or track your usage.*

### Hero Tagline

> Your data stays yours. Your wallet stays happy.
> No subscription. No data mining. Just pay-as-you-go AI starting at $1.

### Feature Section

Replace the "300+ Models" card with a pricing/philosophy card:

> **💵 Pay-as-You-Go, No Subscription**
> No monthly bills. Add as little as $1 to OpenRouter and it lasts until you spend it. The status bar tracks every cent.

### Pricing Section (new component)

Add a dedicated `PricingSection.astro` component with three cards:

1. **Pay OpenRouter Directly** — No markup, no platform fee, no hidden charges
2. **Track Every Cent** — Status bar shows session cost in real time
3. **Free Models Included** — Try without spending with OpenRouter's :free models

Plus a banner: *We're not affiliated with OpenRouter. We don't earn commissions, resell tokens, or track usage.*
